# ZeKstament
ZeKstament is a √êApp built on Ethereum, powered by Aztec Protocol, that lets users create a zero knowledge testament for their Crypto Assets.

# Why
As Cryptocurrencies gain popularity around the globe, we will see an influx of new users buying Crypto Assets. As their journey presumably begins from exchanges like Coinbase, to Binance, some users will eventually find their way to securing their crypto assets by using hardware wallets.

Contrary to the traditional concepts of having the bank as a trusted authority holding an individual's funds, or legal documents expressing an individual's wishes to distribute private property upon death, there are no trusted authorities responsible for distributing one's crypto assets upon death.

ZeKstament allows users to nominate Ethereum addresses to pass on their crypto assets upon death (we will explain below what we consider "death" from Ethereum's perspective).
